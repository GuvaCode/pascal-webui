**qxexample** is an example of a simple console application with two-way binding.

if compiled with `-WG` flag, no console is shown, but `writeln` and `readln` are not possible, you will get `File not open` errors, so comment `writeln` line before compilation.

[Qooxdoo](https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo) universal JavaScript framework is used to generate the interface in the browser.
